          <p>In development limbo as of 21/04/2020. Written in Java with the use of the Lanterna library 
               (which can be found <a href="https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna">here</a>). 
               It is meant to emulate the rough visual appeal of semi-graphical video games from the 1980s. Screenshots of the game (in development) are below.
               Its style is roughly inspired by Dungeons and Dragons, Daggerfall, Runescape, and Minecraft.</p>
